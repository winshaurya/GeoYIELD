# GeoYIELD â€” React + Chart.js Scaffold

This is a minimal single-folder frontend scaffold with React, Vite, and Chart.js (react-chartjs-2).

Quick start:

1. Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

2. Start dev server:

```
npm run dev
```

Visit the printed local address (usually http://localhost:5173) to see the sample chart.

Notes:
- Everything is in the project root as requested (no client/server separation).
- Replace sample data in `src/chart/LineChart.jsx` with your own dataset.
